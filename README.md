Dreamer - A Dream Journal App

Description: Dreamer is a dream journal app that allows you to log what you remember from your dreams. Give your dream a title and a description and easily keep track of each of your posts. This app was created with React, Redux, React Router, Material-UI, Styled-Components, and Firebase.

This project was a ton of fun to create and a massive confidence booster for me. It was a practical way to apply my knowledge about authentication, redux, and styling. The UI was based on Workday's UI with a bit of my own twist to it. 

You can check out a demo of the app here: https://dreamer-app-f7f23.web.app/

Thank you for taking the time to check out my code. It means a lot!
